Hi, I'm Mcenoch Oforha ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m passionate about exploring and building projects at the intersection of Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Herbal Medicine. My goal is to leverage emerging technologies to solve real-world problems and contribute to open-source communities that advance innovation.

Youâ€™ll find a variety of projects here, including blockchain-based applications, AI-driven models, and experiments with decentralized solutions. Iâ€™m always learning, developing, and looking forward to collaborating with other curious minds.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in working together!
